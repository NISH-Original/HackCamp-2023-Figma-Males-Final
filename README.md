HackCamp 2023 repo for team Figma Males

App idea:
- An app that people can use to keep a log of their daily progress, emotions, and challenges (if any) related to their drug rehabilitation.
- They can connect to mentors, and people who have previously overcome the same problems and can talk about their current state of progress and get more tips.
- Some sorta gamified system which reminds, and rewards the user to complete, ranging from some basic tasks like having food, drinking water regularly, etc. to some more complicated stuff like meditation. The rewards can be in form of points that reflect on their profile.
- MAYBE this can be like BeReal where they are notified to do so-and-so task, and they can also take pictures of it and share it with peers, which also motivates them to follow suit.
- Immediate access to all emergency services on the click of a button, if ever so necessary
- A place where they can see if there are any councelling sessions going on nearby.

basically an app that helps in the rehabilitation process of those people who fell victim to drug abuse
ofc these are just ideas, and we can add/subtract stuff based on how much we realistically could be able to accomplish
